# Bobs-Garage
My first full-stack project I have developed.

This was one of my practical assessments for my diploma. Though it's far from perfect it's still something I'm proud of given the amount of knowledge I had prior.

This was developed using React, Redux and Bootstrap for the client-side and Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize and an SQLite database for the server-side.
I'm happy showing this to people even though it's got some issues because it's a good way to show how much I've grown as a web developer since I've made this.
I also find it quite amusing looking back at this and seeing the questionable decisions I made while still figuring out how to use literally everything this project uses.

Feel free to download the files if you would like to play around with it. Since it has an SQLite database the data will remain the same as when I uploaded it.
You will have to install all the modules once you've downloaded it though. You can do this by opening two terminals from VS Code while you're in the project.

For server modules enter the commands "cd server" and then "npm install" in one of your terminals. 

For client modules enter the commands "cd client" and then "npm install" in the other terminal.

To run them enter the command "npm run server" from server terminal to start the server then enter the command "npm start" in the client terminal to load website.

You can register a new user if you want but there are already two users saved for demonstration purposes to make things easier.
Credentials for a regular user are:
* email: test@test.com
* password: Test1234

Credentials for admin user are:
* email: admin@admin.com
* password: Admin1234

Though there are a bunch of small issues here and there I can't be bothered fixing if there are any truly concerning or major issues feel free to let me know.
Feedback is also welcome if you would like to give me some.
